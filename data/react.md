# React.js

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications.

## Key Concepts:
- **Components and Props**: Build reusable UI components.
- **State and Hooks**: Manage component state with useState, useEffect, etc.
- **Context API**: Share data across components without prop drilling.
- **React Router**: Handle navigation in single-page applications.

## Prerequisites:
Before learning React, you should be comfortable with:
- HTML/CSS for building interfaces
- JavaScript fundamentals (ES6+, functions, arrays, objects)
- DOM manipulation concepts

## Why React?
React makes building complex UIs easier by breaking them into reusable components. It's widely used in the industry and has a strong ecosystem.
