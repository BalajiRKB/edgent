# SaaS Architecture

Software as a Service (SaaS) is a software licensing and delivery model where software is hosted centrally and accessed via the internet.

## Key Concepts:
- **Multi-tenancy**: Serve multiple customers from a single application instance.
- **Subscription Billing**: Implement recurring payment systems (Stripe, Paddle).
- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication (Auth0, NextAuth, JWT).
- **API Design**: Build RESTful or GraphQL APIs for your application.
- **Database Design**: Plan for scalability and data isolation.

## Prerequisites:
Building a SaaS requires knowledge of:
- Backend development (Node.js, Python, etc.)
- Frontend framework (React, Vue, etc.)
- Database design and management
- Cloud deployment (AWS, GCP, Azure)

## Why Build a SaaS?
SaaS products offer recurring revenue and scalability. Understanding SaaS architecture is valuable for modern software development.
