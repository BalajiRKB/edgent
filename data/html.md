# HTML Fundamentals

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.

## Key Concepts:
- **Semantic HTML**: Use meaningful tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`.
- **Forms and Validations**: Create interactive forms with input validation.
- **Accessibility (ARIA)**: Make web content accessible to people with disabilities.
- **SEO Basics**: Structure content for better search engine visibility.

## Why Learn HTML First?
HTML is the foundation of all web development. Before you can style with CSS or add interactivity with JavaScript, you need to understand how to structure content properly.
